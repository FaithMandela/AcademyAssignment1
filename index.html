          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>My name is Faith Mandela. I have a Computer Science degree from JKUAT. I am currently a QE Engineer in Safaricom. Preiously 
              I have been a developer focussing mainly on Android. I also have some expeience in MySql and PHP. I picked up on DevOps as 
              an area of multi skilling. This is because I'd like to test products better and perhaps automate the testing by adding the suites 
              to a pipeline.
